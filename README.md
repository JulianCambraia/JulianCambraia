<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  A motivated software developer with 14 years of IT experience, I am curious and proactive with a passion for building quality software and creative solutions. 
  I have been working for 13 years, being 8 years in PHP, HTML, Javascript, and the other 5 years to date with Java, Angular 2,4,5 and 7, oriented to agile methodologies. 
  I venture to say that I am a fast learner and love to experiment and absorb new technologies. 
  In my free time I enjoy walking with my chow chow, reading books, watching series and getting close to nature and friends.</p>
